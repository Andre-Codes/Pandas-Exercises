# Pandas-Exercises
Exploring and learning the **Pandas** library with hands-on exercises

The following exercises will follow the **MAGIC ML** process, some only in part, and some all the way through the model training and evaluating phase.

# MAGIC ML
- ## **M** - Mission: Define your mission and set clear objectives for your machine learning project.
    - Strategize your machine learning project by defining objectives, selecting appropriate algorithms, and outlining the step-by-step approach. Set clear goals and evaluation metrics to guide the entire process effectively.
- ## **A** - Acquire Data: Obtain and collect the relevant data for your project.
    - Gather the necessary data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, or files, to form the dataset for your machine learning project.
- ## **G** - Getting it into shape
    - Preprocess and clean the acquired data to make it suitable for analysis. Handle missing values, outliers, data types, and perform necessary transformations.
- ## **I** - Inspecting & Improve the data
    - Explore the dataset using visualizations and summary statistics to gain insights into the data's characteristics, relationships, and patterns.
- ## **C** - Choose Model: Select the appropriate machine learning model for your task.
    - Select the best-fit machine learning models based on the project's objectives, dataset characteristics, and problem type. Evaluate and fine-tune models to ensure optimal performance and accurate predictions.
- ## **M** - Modeling the data
    - Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for the problem at hand. Split the data into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
- ## **L** - Learning from the data
    - Train the chosen models on the training data. Fine-tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance using the testing data.
